A library for using the Windows GUI easily.

Developed under Visual Studio 2019 (2022 Preview) and Windows 10. Theoretically will work with Vista and later windows.
The aim of the project is personal usage. You may copy it, use it.
When I have time, I will try to add more controls.

Library under the EasyWindows directory, usage sample under the TestEasyWindows directory.
